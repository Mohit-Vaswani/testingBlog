### Models

- [LLaVA](https://llava-vl.github.io/) (2023): LLaVA-1.5 excels in 11 benchmarks with minimal changes from LLaVA, using only public data, quick training in ~1 day on a single 8-A100 node, and outperforming billion-scale data methods. It's a powerful multimodal model, rivaling GPT-4 in chat capabilities and setting a new Science QA accuracy record. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA">(code)</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485">(paper)</a> 

- [SeamlessM4T](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication): Meta AI's advanced translation model, effortlessly enables speech and text communication across diverse languages. Supporting speech recognition and translation in nearly 100 languages, it unifies speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and text-to-text capabilities. This single-system model improves efficiency, quality, and addresses limitations of existing translation systems, marking a significant step toward a universal translator. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/seamless_m4t">(live model)</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/seamlessm4t-massively-multilingual-multimodal-machine-translation/">(paper)</a> <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-m4t/">(blog)</a> 

- [Fuyu-8B](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b), an <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.adept.ai/">ADEPT</a> multimodal model, excels at text and image comprehension. It simplifies the traditional transformer architecture, making it easier to grasp, scale, and deploy. Fuyu-8B handles complex visual relationships, including charts and documents, and performs tasks like OCR and text localization in images.
