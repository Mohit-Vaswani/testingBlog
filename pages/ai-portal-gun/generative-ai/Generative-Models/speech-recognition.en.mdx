# Automatic Speech Recognition

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) employs machine learning algorithms to convert spoken language into text, enabling machines to understand and transcribe human speech. It finds applications in voice commands, transcription services, and various other tasks.

### Speech to Text Models

- [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper), an ASR system by OpenAI, transcribes English and multiple languages, also translating non-English languages to English. Trained on 680,000 hours of web data, it excels in handling accents, background noise, and technical language. While having text prediction limitations, Whisper shows strong ASR results in ~10 languages, enhancing accessibility tools. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3">(model)</a>

### Advancements

- [Seamless Communication](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication): Meta AI's cutting-edge Seamless Communication models are a major stride in eliminating language barriers. These models, including <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/seamless-expressive">SeamlessExpressive</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/seamless-streaming">SeamlessStreaming</a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/seamless-m4t-v2-large">SeamlessM4T v2</a>, offer fast, high-quality translation, preserving expression, minimizing latency, and improving multilingual communication by capturing human nuances in speech-to-speech translation. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ai.meta.com/research/seamless-communication/">(blog)</a>
